# BitFabric AI Integration Module

This folder contains the dedicated AI worker for the BitFabric platform, integrating with [Brainfuct](https://github.com/draeder/brainfuct).

## Files

- **index.js** - Main entry point. Connects to BitFabric with the AI credentials and listens for requests.
- **package.json** - Dependencies (uses the local NPM/bitfabric library).
- **README.md** - Full documentation.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the AI worker listening for incoming requests on the `ai-request` topic and publishing responses to `ai-response`.
